This add-on adds the ability to create a custom set of grid scales in the Viewport Overlays panel and easily switch between them on the fly. This is similar to options available in Maya and Unreal Engine.

This is very useful when sticking to increments across software as it allows you to set a custom list of the same increments you use in other software like Unreal Engine.

The default keys are the bracket keys with [ moving down the list of custom grid scales, and ] moving up the list. These can be changed in the keymap preferences.
