Allows for the creation of custom grid size increments allowing you to easily switch between them like in Maya and UE. Instead of manually changing the grid scale, you can set your preferred increments, and toggle through them using the bracket keys.

Add grid sizes to the list in the Viewport Overlays panel. 
Switch between grid sizes on the fly with left and right bracket keys. (If this does not work, resolve any keymap conflicts in your Blender settings.)
